Boilerplate React + Stylus project
==================================

This is my boilerplate [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) project
using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) as the build tool, and
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) as my CSS preprocessor.

Probably will be converted into a [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yo)
generator (once I actually start using Yeoman)
